                3. Even when we know that nothing in this world is eternal, I know deep down that you and I will live together till eternity. I will love you forever, and I will never fall out of love with you. I am always here to be your lover until the end of time.
                4. Every day is a celebration of having you in my life.I thank God for making it possible for us to cross the path right from the beginning because that was where my life gained so much impact on your love.
                I can’t love you enough because you are a precious jewel in my world.
                5. Everything you do… The way you eat, the way you smile, the way my name rolls off of your tongue… That all is what keeps me going. It gives me so much joy to watch you be you. I would never give my attention to anyone else because I love giving it to you. The day when you were born, it was raining. Actually, it wasn’t raining itself, but heaven was crying for losing the most beautiful angel!

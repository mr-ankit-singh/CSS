        container {
          align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | 
                        stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe;
        }

        normal (default): 
            items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.
        flex-start / start: 
            items packed to the start of the container. 
            The flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
        flex-end / end: 
            items packed to the end of the container. 
            The  flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
        center: 
            items centered in the container
        space-between: 
            items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
        space-around: 
            items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
        space-evenly: 
            items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
        stretch: 
            lines stretch to take up the remaining space

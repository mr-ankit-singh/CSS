#  align-items __#

   -demonstration of differnet alignment options, like all boxes stuck to the top of a flex parent, 
    the bottom, stretched out, or along a baseline
   -This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. 
   -Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).
   -Syntax:
        .container {
          align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | 
                       last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;
        }

        stretch (default): 
            stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
        flex-start / start / self-start: 
            items are placed at the start of the cross axis. 
            The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.
        flex-end / end / self-end: 
            items are placed at the end of the cross axis. 
            The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.
        center:
             items are centered in the cross-axis
        baseline: 
            items are aligned such as their baselines align
